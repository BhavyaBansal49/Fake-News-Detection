# Fake-News-Detection

The following code is to analyze the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv), and create a Logistic Regression Model to predict if the news is fake or not. 

I utilized the headlines and author names and used the default stop words list from the nltk library.

Also, vectorization was performed using the tfidf vectorization method.
